ticket to customer is a many to one relationship because a customer can purchase multiple tickets, but a ticket cannot be purchased by multiple customers. Same for ticket to movie, a movie has many tickets, but a ticket only has one movie. For concession purchases to customer, it is a many to one relationship as well, because a customer can make many purchases, but a purchase only has one customer. The table concession_items_in_purchase (ciip) is  a table to link the concession items (ci) with the concession purchase (cp) tables. The relationship of ciip to ci is one to one. Every row of the ciip table is linking one item to one purchase. For example: if I buy a popcorn and two large sodas, this would create three columns, linking the id's for popcorn and large soda to the id for the purchase. The relationship of ciip to cp is one to one for the same reasons, each row in ciip links to exactly one ci and cp.
